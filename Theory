You have multiple base models.Since we are doing regression,these models will perform regression.We have a dataset which we are giving to the three models and training 
these three models.We will get three output values for the three linear regression model and we need to find the mean of the three data.

Visualization:-
At first we will train the model on only the linear regression.Since the voting Ensemble regression has only algo namely the linear regression,so the line for the linear 
regression and the voting ensemble will be the same.Now I will add SVR(support vector regression) to the linear regression model i.e two different algo working on the same dataset.So the best fit line
obtained will be better.Now after adding decision tree regressor as well,we get a more optimised best fit curve i.e 3 algos in the voting ensemble.
